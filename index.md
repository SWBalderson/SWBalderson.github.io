      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Simon, a senior leader in a UK independent school. My job is to think about
      the impact of technology, adapting our curriculum to make sure
      young people have the skills and character strengths they need to thrive
      in the future.</p>

      <p>I work as a consultant for schools and higher education institutions, helping
      them prepare for the radical changes in jobs, society and education brought about
      by artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h3>Read More</h3>

      <em><a href="https://www.tes.com/news/long-read-rise-ai-teaching-assistant-and-loss-teachings-heart">Times Educational Supplement</a></em>,
